# fuzzy-clock
:clock9: *The time you need to know* :clock3:

## Demo :alarm_clock:
[See fuzzy-clock in action](https://eareese.github.io/fuzzy-clock/)

## About :question:
Shows the current time plus an offset. Offset may be zero.

You know, like when you set the clock a little bit *fast* on purpose. Or not.


## Inspiration :rainbow:

I got the idea from this post ["The Procrastinator's Clock" on Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/157715/The-Procrastinators-Clock).

This implementation isn't probabilistic, in the sense that, once loaded, time doesn't run at an irregular pace. However, that would be a very cool feature and it's on the todo list.

## Plans :melon:
* Probabilistic warping
* Settings UI :wrench:
